## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

For this challenge, I mostly wanted to try out Sass. I was able to get more familiar with how it works but there is still alot of room to learn. I should probably use it in a more complex challenge. Anyways, that's mostly it.
